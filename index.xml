The purpose of rover is to gather system and application data from an environment for diagnostics and troubleshooting in a vein similar to Apple&amp;rsquo;s sysdiagnose; it can then also package up the data and ship it off to an S3 bucket as well.
It is not yet nearly feature complete, but is actually somewhat usable.</description></item><item><title>hashipets</title><link>https://brianshumate.com/projects/hashipets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2017 11:41:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://brianshumate.com/projects/hashipets/</guid><description>The delicate art of snippet curation with pet and peco My hashipets project is a TOML formatted file full of awesome HashiCorp tool command line snippets for the CLI snippet curation tool pet + peco.
