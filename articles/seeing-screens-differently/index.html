the benefit of sight.</p><figure><img src=http://100.115.92.206:1313/articles/seeing-screens-differently/full-page.jpg alt="Screen shot illustration with Apple accessibility logo"><figcaption><h4>Apple Accessibility</h4></figcaption></figure><h2 id=it-all-started-with-a-broken-display>It all Started With a Broken Display</h2><p>I have a nearly new MacBook Pro that has been seeing action in some rough circumstances of late, and while a relatively rugged machine on the outside, it is still a pretty delicate piece of expensive consumer electronics inside.</p><p>As the result of carelessness and daredevilry it ended up with a Retina display of the busted and cracked variety.</p><p>I have multiple machines, so using this particular one as desktop until I can replace the display has worked out thus far with some minor annoyances here and there mostly related to having only an external display available.</p><h2 id=did-you-mean-upgrayedd>Did You Mean Upgrayedd?</h2><p>Recently however, I was prompted to upgrade an application that makes use of a kernel extension.</p><p>This application has previously never given any issue, so I proceeded with the upgrade. Given that I was using the machine that evening and didn&rsquo;t want to be interrupted further, I elected to not restart when prompted to do so.</p><p>Once I was ready for sleep later, I hit the <strong>Restart</strong> button on the installer dialog, powered off the external display and called it a night.</p><h2 id=what-happened>What Happened?</h2><p><em>That&rsquo;s odd,</em> I thought the next morning; when I sat down to some usual daily activities, I noticed that the machine was no longer powered on. That was the first sign of trouble and the first step in a long path of troubleshooting.</p><p>I powered up the laptop — <q>GOHHHHNG</q>&hellip; so far, so good.</p><p>However, the external display did not spring to life as usual, and the indicator on it blinked away while the on-screen display showed that it was still seeking signal from the laptop.</p><p>Hmm, let&rsquo;s try turning it off an on again! Same behavior. Immediately, I did a few basic hardware level things. I reset the SMC with <strong>&#8679;&#8963;&#8997;</strong> plus power. I powered on with <strong>&#8984;&#8997;-p-r</strong> to reset PRAM and let the system restart once more&hellip;</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Well this mystery was sure deepening quickly.</p><p>I let the machine go and jumped onto another system, ran a quick <code>nmap</code> to look for this machine,and noticed no additional devices besides the ones I could account for on the the network.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when it hit me (the old &ldquo;what changed last?&rdquo; question): the upgraded application&rsquo;s kernel extension was probably somehow interfering with the system boot!</p><h2 id=further-debugging>Further Debugging</h2><p>I immediately tried booting into safe mode by holding <strong>&#8679;</strong> while powering on and waiting for the external display. Nothing happened, so I figured that external displays probably do not work in safe mode. As a last resort, I tried Recovery Mode with <strong>&#8984;R</strong> while powering on.</p><p>I got a sync on the external screen, and a simple solid gray screen. Within seconds, a nice voice said, &ldquo;To use English as the main language, press the Return key&rdquo;.</p><p>So here I was, in the recovery mode, but unable to see anything except a gray screen!</p><p>I closed the lid on the machine and voila!</p><p>There was the recovery mode interface staring back at me. At this point, I knew that I could beat this issue. There was just one little problem&hellip;</p><p><em>I had no external keyboard or pointing device on hand.</em></p><h2 id=the-fix>The Fix</h2><p>My plan was to disable the problematic kernel extension so that the machine could normally boot again. At first I was tempted to obtain an external keyboard and mouse so that I could keep the lid closed and proceed with my plan.</p><p>Then, I thought <em>why not try to have the computer help me fix it?</em> and with that, I proceeded to enable VoiceOver with <strong>&#8984;F5</strong> and follow its lead with the laptop open by using nothing but keyboard navigation.</p><p>The steps were roughly as follows:</p><ol><li>Open Disk Utility</li><li>Mount and unlock my primary disk</li><li>Open Terminal</li><li>Locate and remove the kernel extension</li><li>Reboot</li></ol><p>All of the above was carefully performed with a bit of trial and error over the course of approximately 10 minutes. During this whole time, I was constantly mindful that this is what it is like for visually impaired persons to use a computer every single day.</p><p>After the reboot, my trusty MacBook Pro was back in action and I found myself both completely proud to have resolved the problem, and profoundly humbled by the entire experience.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><hr class=fadehr><section class=container><p id=serendipity></p>© 2019
