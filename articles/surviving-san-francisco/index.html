folks I&rsquo;d not seen in a long time or even met yet, and for that I am thankful
to have been to the conference I attended there.</p><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/surviving-san-francisco/three_wise_mushrooms.jpg><figcaption><h4>Three Wise Mushrooms</h4></figcaption></figure><p>I might or might not have also learned a great deal there too, but the jury
is still out on that. (<em>insert nervous laughter here</em>)</p><p>Surviving the trip and returning to <em>the south</em> is also a rewarding
feeling as I am developing a severe dislike of the American travel by airline
experience as I age, and am prone to shutting down during the worst of times
while enduring said travel.</p><p>All that out of the way, this article is about art and photographs. I took
far fewer photographs with my trusty smart phone this time around than ever,
which is both liberating from the perspective of just being in the moment,
but also kind of a bummer in hindsight now that I look over what I was
actually able to capture.</p><p>Here then, are a few different shots that I think represent my mindset in
taking in the particularly nasty, brutish, and short experience of that
area known as <em>Union Square</em>. While there is filth everywhere in sight,
sound, and smell, there is a also a <em>beauty of the struggle</em> and in the simple
artistic expression hidden all around the area as typified by the first
photograph above.</p><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/surviving-san-francisco/stay_warm.jpg><figcaption><h4>Stay Warm</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Amidst the everyday consumption and tunnel visioned quests for greater
prosperity going on in the city are of course, the numerous homeless people.
They&rsquo;re essentially lamp posts, hydrants, or excrement to most area &ldquo;natives&rdquo;
and are to be stepped around or over as such.</p><p>They&rsquo;re to be tuned out like so many advertisements and graffiti. Never mind
that they too are human beings; they are <em>different human beings</em>, a
sub-species unlike the rest of us upwardly mobile and privileged who fight
to keep our shit together within the system so that we might have loved ones
and a place to come home to at the end of each day.</p><p>The streets are cold and unforgiving, so a good drunken stupor and warm
blanket are the coping mechanism needed by many unfortunate folks at the end
of the night.</p><p>If like myself, you <em>do not</em> share the above cold and inhumane view of these
persons, and on the contrary have even half a conscience, you can&rsquo;t help but know
a taste of Siddartha&rsquo;s painful conflicted state by gazing upon those less fortunate
in their most vulnerable condition.</p><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/surviving-san-francisco/castro_trolley.jpg><figcaption><h4>The F Line</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Here is a more typical capture one expects to see from San Francisco; the
famous F Line trolley that runs from The Embarcadero all the way to The
Castro. Everyone who&rsquo;s studied or been to San Francisco knows these iconic and
charmingly antiquated modes of transportation.</p><p>They&rsquo;re simultaneously bold and comforting in that they stand out from all
the surrounding modernity while providing a perpetual shout out to how it
used to be.</p><p>The early morning light present when I spotted her slowly creaking by on
Market Street was nothing short of spectacular and this photograph barely
even begins to convey what I saw that day.</p><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/surviving-san-francisco/stacks.jpg><figcaption><h4>Silent Stacks</h4></figcaption></figure><p>The city&rsquo;s collection of weight never fails to impress upon me; be it
skyscrapers or smokestacks. One can be doing the most mundane of things, such
as fetching a morning coffee and in turning around to face another direction,
the city will reveal her various juxtaposed collections of mass.</p><p>Sheer size and weight counterpoised against our small selves and little lives
is both disturbing and exciting. We built this spectacular city and in turn,
the city builds into us an awe at every moment where the unexpected looms
over any scene it seems to not belong in.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the name of the game here, a paradox of plenty and of nothing &mdash; a balance of extremes that is constantly in motion and always on the horizon.</p><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/surviving-san-francisco/yellow.jpg><figcaption><h4>Yellow was Van Gogh&#39;s Favorite Color</h4></figcaption></figure><p>A homeless man stands out like an anti-ghost of the streets; not panhandling,
not scrounging the sidewalk for cigarette butts, and not really interacting
with anyone in particular.</p><p>He exists there in bold and blazing yellow, like a confused captain whose
ship has recently run aground, appraising the situation of a new day and contemplating his survival. Or is he merely pondering on where he can
score a new pair of shoes?</p><p>Seeing his bare feet, I could not help but be reminded that there was a pair
of shoes lying on the sidewalk presumably without an owner just blocks away&hellip;</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><hr class=fadehr><section class=container><p id=serendipity></p>© 2019
