The main reason that it has been so much fun revolves around the
specific technology stack I am using to design and present them.</p><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/maps-with-public-data/Zodiac_research.jpg alt="A map of the Bay Area, California showing Zodiac case locations."><figcaption><h4>Zodiac: public data and mapping are on to you!</h4></figcaption></figure><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This information is out of date and the embedded maps which used to exist here are now static screenshots.</p><p>The above screenshot shows one example of a San Francisco Bay Area map that
I&rsquo;ve been gradually working on as part of some map related research into
providing a geographical context into a specific set of past events which
occurred in that area (sorry for the vagueness).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been able to quickly create and present some visually interesting
maps which convey useful data on a range of subjects using technologies
from <a href=http://mapbox.com title=MapBox>MapBox</a> such as
<a href=http://mapbox.com/#/tilemill title=TileMill>TileMill</a>,
<a href=http://mapbox.com/#/tilestream title=TileStream>TileStream</a>, and
<a href=http://mapbox.github.com/wax/ title=Wax>Wax</a>.</p><p>Here is a brief overview of the MapBox solution, and some of the maps I
have recently created with it.</p><h2 id=think-globally-map-locally>Think globally, map locally</h2><p>As you&rsquo;ll see, the following maps all center around my local area, and since
I&rsquo;m mostly experimenting with the technology right now, these maps are on
random subjects, though I do strive to ensure they are accurate. Please
tweet <a href=http://twitter.com/brianshumate>@brianshumate</a> if
you find any serious flaw, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to fix it.</p><h3 id=longboarding-spots-in-boone-north-carolina>Longboarding spots in Boone, North Carolina</h3><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/maps-with-public-data/Boone_longboarding_spots.jpg alt="A map showing longboarding spots in Boone, North Carolina"><figcaption><h4>Longboarding spots in Boone, North Carolina</h4></figcaption></figure><p>I&rsquo;d previously made some nice maps with longboarding
spots I frequent in Boone, NC based on
<a href=http://www.openstreetmap.org/ title=OpenStreetMap>OpenStreetMap</a>, so I
thought I&rsquo;d do something like that with the MapBox tools first.</p><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that what you see in the above map is not just a
service that I am pointing to and dropping markers on. This map was
designed using <a href=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2009/tgrshp2009.html title="2009 TIGER/Line&amp;reg; Shapefiles">U.S. Census
Bureau</a>
data combined with my own <a href=http://geojson.org/ title=GeoJSON>GeoJSON</a> data
and styling rules using TileMill to arrive at the look and feel it has,
including the styling of land areas, roadways, water bodies, marker
data, and legends.</p><p>The TileMill application is available for OS X or Linux. It has a most excellent and intuitive user interface and will quickly feel familiar to web folks.</p><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/maps-with-public-data/TileMill_user_interface.jpg alt="A screenshot showing the Mapbox TileMill software graphical user interface"><figcaption><h4>Mapbox TileMill GUI</h4></figcaption></figure><p>The TileMill app (<em>shown in screen shot above</em>) has an excellent browser
based user interface where you use the CSS-like language
<a href=https://github.com/mapbox/carto title="carto styling language">carto</a> to
define the styles for your map&rsquo;s layers and data. There&rsquo;s also a very
handy carto reference built right into TileMill.</p><p><strong>Carto</strong> is an advanced CSS like language with nesting, variables, and
other cool features similar to CSS meta languages like LESS and SASS.</p><p>The <strong>MBTiles</strong> specification is an interesting new way to store map
tilesets and their associated metadata in an SQLite database.</p><p>After designing the map in TileMill, I use its export features to
generate a set of image tiles in a format
(<a href=http://mbtiles.org/>MBTiles</a> that the
TileStream tile server can serve up to any kind of web application or
site imaginable. TileMill can also export your map creations as PNG or
PDF images, too.</p><p>Finally, I use the <a href=http://modestmaps.com/ title="Modest Maps">Modest Maps</a>
and
<a href=https://github.com/mapbox/wax title="Wax open source web mapping tools">Wax</a>
libraries to stream the map tilesets from my TileStream server, and
display them here as embedded interactive maps!</p><p>That&rsquo;s also putting it quite modestly, indeed; you can do some seriously
amazing things with this trio of technologies, and some solid JavaScript
chops.</p><p>The <a href=http://developmentseed.org/ title="Development Seed">Development Seed home
page</a> is a perfect
example of the kinds of amazing map visualizations one can create with
these tools.</p><h2 id=terrain-visualization>Terrain visualization</h2><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/maps-with-public-data/Boone_shaded_map.jpg alt="A terrain visualization map of Watauga county, North Carolina"><figcaption><h4>Terrain visualization map of Watauga county, North Carolina</h4></figcaption></figure><p>For creating the terrain visualization in the above map screenshot,
I consulted MapBox documentation on using GDAL DEM utilities and STRM image
data: <a href=http://support.mapbox.com/kb/tilemill/terrain-visualization-with-digital-elevation-models-and-gdal title="Terrain visualization with digital elevation models and GDAL">Terrain visualization with digital elevation models and
GDAL</a>.</p><p>This simple map is a proof of concept, and uses only one interactive
layer, the names of Watauga county communities, which are displayed on
mouse over.</p><p>I learned quickly from making maps like this one, that it is a very
serious craft requiring one work with a blend of design concerns like
color theory along with more nerdy pursuits, such as command line
wrangling.</p><p>Note that I am not a Cartographer and I have a lot to learn about map
making, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to making even better and more visually
interesting maps with these tools in the future.</p><p>Here are all of the Github repositories for the MapBox projects mentined
in this post: <a href=https://github.com/mapbox/carto title=Carto>Carto</a>,
<a href=https://github.com/mapbox/tilemill title=TileMill>TileMill</a>,
<a href=https://github.com/mapbox/tilestream title=TileStream>TileStream</a>,
<a href=https://github.com/mapbox/wax title=Wax>Wax</a></p><p>As I previously mentioned, the documentation for all of Mapbox&rsquo;s tools
is great; it&rsquo;s well written, and uses good examples. Further, the
projects are all open source and accessible on
<a href=https://github.com/mapbox title="MapBox Github">Github</a>.</p><h2 id=watauga-county-food-service-ratings>Watauga County food service ratings</h2><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/maps-with-public-data/Wautaga_food_service_ratings.jpg alt="A map of Watauga county, North Carolina restaurants color coded by linked county food safety rating"><figcaption><h4>Watauga county, North Carolina restaurants color coded by food safety rating</h4></figcaption></figure><p>This map combines public health inspection data which is scraped and
converted to GeoJSON for restaurants and other food service services
with the restaurant locations color coded by rating.</p><p>You can hover over each point for the name of the location and the
rating, and you can click to get a bit more information for a given
location.</p><h2 id=in-summary>In summary</h2><p>The data used for these maps comes from the following sources: <a href=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2009/tgrshp2009.html>2009
TIGER/Line&reg;
Shapefiles</a>,
<a href=http://watauga.nc.gegov.com/index.cfm title="Watauga County Health Department">Watauga County Health
Department</a>,
<a href=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/ title="Shuttle Radar Topography Mission">Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission</a>,
and my phone&rsquo;s GPS. :)</p><p>The MapBox stack is very well made open source software with great
attention to detail, and the folks behind it are responsive, helpful,
and friendly. I&rsquo;m looking forward to making more awesome maps, and
seeing where this solution goes.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><hr class=fadehr><section class=container><p id=serendipity></p>© 2019
