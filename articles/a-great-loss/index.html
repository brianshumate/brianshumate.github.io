inked on my arm. :-)</p><p>— 42-Byte Nonce (@brianshumate) March 25, 2011</p></blockquote><p>He then asked me for a pic:</p><blockquote><p><a href=https://twitter.com/brianshumate>@brianshumate</a> pic?</p><p>— Aaron Swartz (@aaronsw) <a href=https://twitter.com/aaronsw/status/51344922812497920>March 25,
2011</a></p></blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t have an Instagram account or really use my Twitter account any longer,
so here is the image that I replied with on that day:</p><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/a-great-loss/Cherokee.jpg><figcaption><h4>My ᏣᎳᎩ Tattoo</h4></figcaption></figure><p>A typical brief exchange on Twitter — I&rsquo;d also expressed interest in
some of his personal projects and working with him on those, but we&rsquo;d
unfortunately never managed to make that happen.</p><h2 id=thanks-for-everything>Thanks for Everything</h2><p>Aaron was an exceptional human being who exerted incredible amounts of
energy in the true hacker spirit while pursuing a never-ending quest for
knowledge. He also made some significant changes in this world.</p><p>Here are some things he did or helped to do:</p><ul><li>He helped with development of
<a href=http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/>RSS</a></li><li>He helped with development of
<a href=http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>Markdown</a></li><li>He helped organize <a href=https://creativecommons.org/>Creative Commons</a></li><li>He created <a href=http://webpy.org/>web.py</a></li><li>He helped to build <a href=http://www.reddit.com/>reddit</a></li><li>He founded <a href=https://demandprogress.org/>Demand Progress</a></li><li>He was instrumental in helping to defeat
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act>SOPA</a></li></ul><p>This is of course, a fantastic track record and a list of amazing
contributions for a person of such a young age.</p><p>If you are not familiar with the life of Aaron Swartz, you can learn a
good deal about him by watching the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXr-2hwTk58">The Internet&rsquo;s Own
Boy</a>.</p><h2 id=we-miss-you>We Miss You</h2><p>A great deal of folks miss Aaron and the list of those who actually knew
him well is long. There is no telling what he could have accomplished if
he could have remained here with us, and I think that we all wonder
about that a lot. That our government here in the United States bullied
him until he apparently could no longer live a peaceful existence is
unfortunate, sad, and most tragic.</p><p>I am often saddened by the loss of Aaron to his family and to our
greater community of nerds, and also upset that I could not have known
him better.</p><p>Most of all, I am sad for the loss of such potential he could have
continued to share with and for a better world, but I am always happy
that he lived.</p><p>I celebrate his life and all he gave us.</p><p>Rest in peace, Aaron.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><hr class=fadehr><section class=container><p id=serendipity></p>© 2019
