<h2 id="aaron-swartz-november-8-1986-january-11-2013">Aaron Swartz • November 8, 1986 – January 11,&nbsp;2013</h2>
<p>I did not know Aaron very well at all; There were but a few exchanges of
communication between us in email and on&nbsp;Twitter.</p>
<p>One time, he mentioned that ᏣᎳᎩ was perhaps his favorite name for a&nbsp;language.</p>
<p>Being that I strongly agreed and had recently gotten the letters ᏣᎳᎩ tattooed
on my body, I&nbsp;responded:</p>
<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/aaronsw">@aaronsw</a> Me too, but it&#39;s in my blood <span class="amp">&amp;</span> inked on my arm.&nbsp;:-)</p>&mdash; 42-Byte Nonce (@brianshumate) <a href="https://twitter.com/brianshumate/status/51344822161784832">March 25, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>

<p>He then asked me for a&nbsp;pic:</p>
<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brianshumate">@brianshumate</a>&nbsp;pic?</p>&mdash; Aaron Swartz (@aaronsw) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronsw/status/51344922812497920">March 25, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>

<p>Being that I don’t have an Instagram account any longer, here is what I
replied with on that&nbsp;day:</p>
<p><img src="/articles/a-great-loss/ᏣᎳᎩ.jpg" alt="ᏣᎳᎩ Tattoo"></p>
<p>It was a typical brief exchange on Twitter. I’d also expressed interest in
some of his personal projects and working with him on those, but we’d never
really managed to make that&nbsp;happen.</p>
<h2 id="thanks-for-everything">Thanks for&nbsp;everything</h2>
<p>Aaron was an exceptional human being who exerted incredible amounts of
energy in the true hacker spirit while pursuing a never-ending quest for
knowledge. He also made some significant changes in this&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Here are but a few things he did or helped to&nbsp;do:</p>
<ul>
<li>He was involved in the development of <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/"><span class="caps">RSS</span></a></li>
<li>He was involved in the development of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a></li>
<li>He helped organize <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative&nbsp;Commons</a></li>
<li>He created <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a></li>
<li>He helped to build <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a></li>
<li>He founded <a href="https://demandprogress.org/">Demand&nbsp;Progress</a></li>
<li>He was instrumental in helping to defeat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act"><span class="caps">SOPA</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is of course, a fantastic track record and a list of absolutely amazing
contributions for a person of such a young&nbsp;age.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the life of Aaron Swartz, you can learn a good
deal about him by watching the documentary
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXr-2hwTk58">The Internet’s Own Boy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="missed">Missed</h2>
<p>Aaron is missed by many and the list of those who actually knew him well
is quite long. There is no telling what he could have accomplished if he
could have remained here with us, and I think that we all wonder about that
a lot. It is unfortunate, sad, and most tragic that he was bullied by our
government here in the United States until he apparently could no longer live
a peaceful&nbsp;existence.</p>
<p>I am often saddened by the loss of Aaron to his family and to our greater
community of nerds, and perhaps selfishly upset that I could not have known
him&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Most of all, I am sad for the loss of such potential he could
have continued to share with and for a better world, but I am always happy
that he ever existed at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Rest in peace,&nbsp;Aaron.</p>
