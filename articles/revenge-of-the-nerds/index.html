and circuits, especially in a university setting was the stereotypical jock.</p><p>Brutish and banal, these beastly characters were to be avoided and feared for
they could pummel a fragile pencil-necked geek into a pocket-protected pulp.</p><p>There were even films made to reflect this condition, with the most popular
being <a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/>&ldquo;Revenge of the Nerds&rdquo;</a>.</p><figure><img src=https://brianshumate.com/articles/revenge-of-the-nerds/revenge-of-the-nerds.jpg alt="Photograph of characters from the movie Revenge Of The Nerds"><figcaption><h4>Lambda Lambda Lambda or the nerd popularity event horizon</h4></figcaption></figure><p>In this movie (highly recommended by the way), nerds use their supreme
intelligence to overcome thuggish football players in the ultimate
celebration of brains over brawn.</p><p>The nerddom evidenced in the 1980s slowly became a sort of cause célèbre that
eventually elevated nerds to mythical status as the information age
progressed. Nerds were somehow and almost inexplicably becoming <em>cool</em>.</p><p>Fast forward to now: long gone are the once justified fears of feeble-minded
ogres beating the shit out of poor nerds. Nerds have turned the tables, and
in their own way, have become quasi villains to be feared by the general
populace.</p><ol><li>Nerds watch our every move, know our every desire and favorite thing, then
use this information to try and sell that thing to us</li><li>Nerds are at the heart of wickedly clever financial heists where the crooks
never leave the comforts of their Aeron</li><li>Nerds form the center of subterfuge and sabotage while waging war as
state-sponsored threat actors — can I get a <q>Cyber! Cyber! Cyber!</q>, y&rsquo;all?</li><li>Nerds remain a community whose majority is dominated by insecure males
who struggle in adjusting to adult life without their mother&rsquo;s help while
creating hostile and shitty environments for the minorities around them who wish to also be accepted as the nerds they truly are</li><li>Nerds help design an build robotic death machines which seek and destroy
both intended targets along with so-called <em>collateral damage</em></li><li>Nerds dodge the law within certain government entities to soak up all of
our data, store them, classify them, mine them, and use them against us</li></ol><p>Gone are the days of worrying about jocks doing physical damage — indeed,
all nerds (and the rest of the world) have to worry about now are
<em>other nerds</em>.</p><p>Nerds have ultimately taken their revenge on the whole world.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><hr class=fadehr><section class=container><p id=serendipity></p>© 2019
