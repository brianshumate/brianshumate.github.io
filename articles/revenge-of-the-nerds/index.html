          <section class="content"><p>Being a nerd in the 1980s was an arduous&nbsp;existence.</p>
<p><span class="more" /></p>
<p>A great threat to swelling one’s brain with knowledge and cavorting with code
and circuits, especially in a university setting was the stereotypical&nbsp;jock.</p>
<p>Brutish and banal, these beastly characters were to be avoided and feared for
they could pummel a fragile pencil-necked geek into a pocket-protected&nbsp;pulp.</p>
<p>There were even films made to reflect this condition, with the most popular
being “Revenge of the&nbsp;Nerds”.</p>
<p>In this movie, the nerds use their supreme intelligence to overcome thuggish
football players in the ultimate celebration of brains over&nbsp;brawn.</p>
<p>Indeed, the nerddom evidenced in the 1980s movies slowly became a sort of
cause célèbre that eventually elevated nerds to mythical status as the
information age&nbsp;progressed.</p>
<p>Long gone are the once justified fears of feeble-minded ogres beating the
shit out of poor&nbsp;nerds.</p>
<p>Nerds watch our every move, know our every desire and favorite thing, then
use this information to try and sell that thing to&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>Nerds are hostile whether unintentionally or not — to other nerds not like
themselves, and essentially impede the progress of humankind with exclusion
and&nbsp;prejudice.</p>
<p>Nerds are at the heart of wickedly clever financial heists where the crooks
never leave the comforts of their&nbsp;Aeron.</p>
<p>Nerds form the center of subterfuge and sabotage while waging war as
state-sponsored threat&nbsp;actors.</p>
<p>Nerds help design an build robotic death machines which seek and destroy both
intended targets along with so-called collateral&nbsp;damage.</p>
<p>Nerds skirt the law within three-letter government entities to soak up all of
our data, store them, classify them, mine them, and use them against&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of worrying about jocks — alas, all nerds
(and the rest of the world) have to worry about now are other&nbsp;nerds.</p>
<p>Nerds have taken their revenge on the whole&nbsp;world.</p>
