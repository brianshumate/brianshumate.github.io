        <p>This is a personal review of the video zine <a href="http://www.blueanarchy.org/holdfast/">Hold
Fast</a>. These are stories of maniac sailors, anarchist castaways, and the voyage of the S/V Pestilence.</p>
<p>Fun fact: I keep a copy of <em>Hold Fast</em> on my person at all times.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, one of my absolute favorite independently made
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->films<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->video zines<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of all time is <a href="http://www.blueanarchy.org/holdfast/">Hold
Fast</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting, endearing, and nicely made record of sailing and love
of the sea that has a genuinely intimate feel like a well-captured home
movie. You can <a href="http://www.blueanarchy.org/holdfast/download.html">download the video</a>
from the Anarchist Yacht Clubb or <a href="http://vimeo.com/15351476">watch it on
Vimeo</a>, and feel like you&rsquo;re invited to
tag along for this totally punk rock seafaring adventure.</p>
<p>The film opens with a sensory storm of creaking, clanking, and thrashing
sounds and sights of the sea serving as backdrop over which <a href="http://thoughtcrime.org/">Moxie
Marlinspike</a> recites verse from <em>O Listen to
the Sounding Sea</em> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William_Curtis">George William
Curtis</a>.</p>
<p>Swiftly then, Marlinspike proceeds into an introduction to contemporary
fiberglass yachts introduced to the middle class in the 1960s, with an
emphasis on their affordable plenitude. <a href="http://www.blueanarchy.org/">The Anarchist Yacht
Clubb</a> gets an introduction - along with the
notion of obtaining one&rsquo;s own plastic boat.</p>
<h3 id="be-ye-of-much-inspiration">Be ye of much inspiration</h3>
<p>After the introduction to yachting possibilities made possible by the
ubiquitous nature of fiberglass boats, we&rsquo;re treated to some
inspirational stories of long voyages, record setters, and truly amazing
sailors.</p>
<p>A brief introduction to the concept of <em>citizen of the sea</em> is most
interesting; there are abundant deep contemplative connections to the ocean
to consider here as the zen of this video zine thickens - in no time,
we&rsquo;re prepared for the journeys ahead.</p>
<h3 id="the-sv-pestilence">The S/V Pestilence</h3>
<p>Marlinspike meets with friends in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, where he&rsquo;s
found a suitable vessel for their sailing adventures ahead. The vessel
is a Pearson 30, purchased for one thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Now that the complete crew has converged to begin working on the boat,
we meet <strong>Lisa</strong>, <strong>Allie</strong>, <strong>Kirsten</strong>, and <strong>Moxie</strong>
(the zine&rsquo;s narrator protagonist).</p>
<figure>

            <h4>The S/V Pestilence</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Many fun anecdotes and interesting hijinks are recalled about the time
spent working on the boat, named <em>Pestilence</em>. When it&rsquo;s ready, the crew sail
all summer in the Florida Keys, leaving Pestilence on Grand Bahama
at the conclusion of their summer&rsquo;s sailing.</p>
<h3 id="next-year">Next year</h3>
<p>The next year, the crew once again rendezvous and aim to take to the
seas aboard Pestilence. Before sailing again, the boat needs much
refurbishing and mold eradication. In little time the work is done, and
the gang are off again to fair winds and following seas.</p>
<p>This time around there is much more adventure, as the gang tour the
Caribbean, and we&rsquo;re educated with all kinds of sailing knowledge, from
that of the most dubious sounding &ldquo;direct deposit&rdquo;, to rowing out
anchors, and sailing without the aid of an iron sail (engine/prop).</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="fine-dining-as-a-citizen-of-the-sea">Fine dining as a citizen of the sea</h3>
<p>In one raw and startling scene, sure to upset any with weak stomachs or an
aversion to natural (if not primitive) food harvesting methods,
Moxie catches a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahi-mahi">Mahi Mahi</a>
while under sail, and the crew land, kill, and decapitate it in a bloody
mess aboard the Pestilence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s grabbing narrative by Moxie accompanying this moment, about the
difficulties in quickly killing fish, and how the Mahi Mahi
(dolphin-fish) color fades out almost immediately upon dying. This
particular Mahi Mahi feeds the gang for three days.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-way">Finding the way</h3>
<p>From food gathering to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead
reckoning</a>, the
information and anecdotes about navigation presented in Hold Fast is
simultaneously fascinating and useful.</p>
<p>During this time, the crew is actually sailing off course due to some errors
in their dead reckoning navigation. They were on the verge of hitting all
kinds of hazards and terrors without having any idea about it. This was
enforcement of the reality that it is actually somewhat difficult to fully run aground or otherwise commit to an accidental nautical nightmare.</p>
<p>There is then an interesting interlude into foul weather sailing, with
some convincing examples. Things get rough, and of course, massively wet, as the little Pestilence chops through the rough seas during waterspouts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can scream, you can beg for mercy - you can stamp your feet or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
even appeal to the sensibilities of the great Neptune himself, but in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
the end, there&rsquo;s nothing to do, but hold fast. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
—Moxie Marlinspike</p>

</figure>

<p>Finally, the storms are over - the crew makes landfall at the Turks and
Caicos, before heading on to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>The end of the zine is imminent as Moxie tours around Haiti and the
Dominican Republic, before heading back to San Francisco. We&rsquo;re told
that the Pestilence is standing by in the Dominican Republic, while
Kirsten is building a house, Allie is living in the woods, and Lisa is
harvesting syrup.</p>
<h2 id="until-next-time">Until next time&hellip;</h2>
<p>UPDATE: I wrote this based on repeated viewings of the original video
zine - there&rsquo;s since been an updated version released that is much more
polished, but still the same awesome video zine! <strong>Great work!</strong></p>
<p>This zine represents the finest in inspirational carefree jaunts over
the seas, and is a complete joy to watch. If you&rsquo;re seeking the most
amazing sailing video zine (<strong>of all time</strong>), you should check out
