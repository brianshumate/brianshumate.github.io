<p>Without a doubt, one of my absolute favorite independently made
<del>films</del> <em>video zines</em> of all time is <a href="http://www.blueanarchy.org/holdfast/">Hold
Fast</a>.</p>
<p>It is an exciting, endearing, and simply made record of sailing and love
of the sea that has a genuinely intimate feel like a well-captured home
movie. You can <a href="http://www.blueanarchy.org/holdfast/download.html">download the video</a>
from the Anarchist Yacht Clubb or <a href="http://vimeo.com/15351476">watch it on
Vimeo</a>, and feel like you’ve been invited to
tag along for this totally punk rock seafaring&nbsp;adventure.</p>
<p>The film opens with a sensory storm of creaking, clanking, and thrashing
sounds and sights of the sea serving as backdrop over which <a href="http://thoughtcrime.org/">Moxie
Marlinspike</a> recites verse from <em>O Listen to
the Sounding Sea</em> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William_Curtis">George William
Curtis</a>.</p>
<p>Swiftly then, Marlinspike proceeds into an introduction to contemporary
fiberglass yachts introduced to the middle class in the 1960s, with an
emphasis on their affordable plenitude. <a href="http://www.blueanarchy.org/">The Anarchist Yacht
Clubb</a> is introduced - along with the
notion of obtaining one’s own plastic&nbsp;boat.</p>
<h3 id="be-ye-of-much-inspiration">Be ye of much&nbsp;inspiration</h3>
<p>After the introduction to yachting possibilities made possible by the
ubiquitous nature of fiberglass boats, we’re treated to some
inspirational stories of long voyages, record setters, and truly amazing&nbsp;sailors.</p>
<p>A brief introduction to the concept of <em>citizen of the sea</em> is most
interesting; there are many deep contemplative connections to the ocean
to consider here as the zen of this video zine thickens - in no time,
we’re prepared for the journeys&nbsp;ahead.</p>
<h3 id="the-s-v-pestilence">The S/V&nbsp;Pestilence</h3>
<p>Marlinspike meets with friends in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, where he’s
found a suitable vessel for their sailing adventures ahead. The vessel
is a Pearson 30, which is purchased for one thousand&nbsp;dollars.</p>
<p>Now that the complete crew has converged to begin working on the boat,
we are introduced to: <strong>Lisa</strong>, <strong>Allie</strong>, <strong>Kirsten</strong>, and <strong>Moxie</strong>
(the zine’s narrator&nbsp;protagonist).</p>
<p><img src="/articles/hold-fast/hold_fast_pestilence.jpg" alt="" title="S/V Pestilence"></p>
<p>Many fun anecdotes and interesting hijinks are recalled about the time
spent working on the boat, named <em>Pestilence</em>. When it is finally
ready, the crew sail all summer in the Florida Keys, eventually leaving
Pestilence on Grand Bahama at the conclusion of their summer’s&nbsp;sailing.</p>
<h3 id="next-year">Next&nbsp;year</h3>
<p>The next year, the crew once again rendezvous and aim to take to the
seas aboard Pestilence. Before sailing again, the boat needs much
refurbishing and mold eradication. In little time the work is done, and
the gang are off again to fair winds and following&nbsp;seas.</p>
<p>This time around there is much more adventure, as the gang tour the
Caribbean, and we’re educated with all kinds of sailing knowledge, from
that of the most dubious sounding “direct deposit”, to rowing out
anchors, and sailing without the aid of an iron sail&nbsp;(engine/prop).</p>
<p><img src="/articles/hold-fast/mahi-mahi.jpg" alt="" title="Mahi Mahi"></p>
<h3 id="fine-dining-as-a-citizen-of-the-sea">Fine dining as a citizen of the&nbsp;sea</h3>
<p>In one particularly raw and shocking scene, sure to upset any with weak
stomachs or an aversion to completely natural food gathering methods,
Moxie catches a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahi-mahi">Mahi Mahi</a>
while under sail, and the crew land, kill, and eventually decapitate it
in a bloody mess aboard the&nbsp;Pestilence.</p>
<p>There’s grabbing narrative by Moxie accompanying this moment, about the
difficulties in quickly killing fish, and how the Mahi Mahi
(dolphin-fish) color fades out almost immediately upon dying. This
particular Mahi Mahi feeds the gang for three&nbsp;days.</p>
<p><img src="/articles/hold-fast/nautical_chart.jpg" alt="" title="Nautical chart"></p>
<h3 id="finding-the-way">Finding the&nbsp;way</h3>
<p>From food gathering to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead
reckoning</a>, the
information and anecdotes about navigation presented in Hold Fast is
simultaneously fascinating and&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>During this time however, the crew is actually sailing off course due to
some errors in their dead reckoning navigation. They were literally on
the verge of hitting all kinds of hazards and terrors without having any
idea about it. This was enforcement of the reality that it is actually
somewhat difficult to fully run aground or otherwise accidentally commit
to a nautical&nbsp;nightmare.</p>
<p>There is then an interesting interlude into foul weather sailing, with
some convincing examples. Things get quite rough, and of course very
wet, as the little Pestilence chops through the rough seas during huge&nbsp;waterspouts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can scream, you can beg for mercy - you can stamp your feet or <br>
even appeal to the sensibilities of the great Neptune himself, but in <br>
the end, there’s nothing to do, but hold fast. <br>
<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Moxie&nbsp;Marlinspike</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/articles/hold-fast/hold_fast_sun_on_horizon.jpg" alt="" title="Hold Fast sun on horizon"></p>
<p>Finally, the storms are over and progress is made - the crew makes
landfall at the Turks and Caicos, before heading on to the Dominican&nbsp;Republic.</p>
<p>The end of the zine is imminent as Moxie tours around Haiti and the
Dominican Republic, before heading back to San Francisco. We’re told
that the Pestilence is standing by in the Dominican Republic, while
Kirsten is building a house, Allie is living in the woods, and Lisa is
harvesting&nbsp;syrup.</p>

<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: I wrote this based on numerous viewings of the original video
zine - there’s since been an updated version released that is much more
polished, but still the same awesome video zine! <strong>Great&nbsp;work!</strong></p>
<p>This zine represents the finest in inspirational carefree jaunts over
the seas, and is a complete joy to watch. If you’re seeking the most
amazing sailing video zine (<strong>of all time</strong>), you should check out
