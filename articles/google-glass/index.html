<p>This is not a generalized <em>oh, my privacy</em>! exploration into the
implications of the technology, rather it is an enumeration of specific
real-world problems which could result from regularly using Glass. I’d like
to also stress that I did not put these words down to pour water on the Glass
flame, but to merely point out some valid concerns that I have as a
technologist and human&nbsp;being.</p>
<p>I use a bit of rough language at times and a tongue-in-cheek attitude for
some of my points because I’m a just some guy and this is just
some guy’s&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>While much of my thinking on the topic is quite serious, the nature of this
list is not academic, terribly scientific, or even remotely professional. I
am just shooting the shit here with you about the&nbsp;technology.</p>
<h2 id="0-made-by-a-large-advertising-machine">0. Made by a large advertising&nbsp;machine</h2>
<p>Google is perhaps now the largest marketing data aggregator and advertising
machine on Earth. Why would anyone want to wear something on a daily basis
that has the potential to gather the most detailed demographics a person
could offer up to such an advertising and marketing&nbsp;machine?</p>
<p>All of the promotional videos feature one perceived benefit after another
for the user. However, just as with search, Gmail, and every other service,
Google will be the ones who ultimately gain the most benefit from your
use of Glass and related&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>Basically, all substantial data generated by Glass will pass through
some part of Google to be used by them in the ways they’ve specified in
those long user agreements that hardly anyone actually&nbsp;reads.</p>
<h2 id="1-an-antenna-and-transceiver-device">1. An antenna and transceiver&nbsp;device</h2>
<p>Do you really want a device containing a transceiver and antenna pushing
radio frequency (<span class="caps">RF</span>) energy from the ultra high frequency (UHF) Bluetooth,
cellular, and Wi-Fi spectrums in such close proximity to your&nbsp;head?</p>
<p>While there is not much in the way of definitive evidence showing dangers
posed by concentrating <span class="caps">UHF</span> RF energy near the human head, I will continue to
err on the side of caution with respect to this point. There’s only been
about 15 years of research into this issue and we simply are not yet sure
about the dangers of prolonged RF energy interaction with the human&nbsp;body.</p>
<p>Consider the&nbsp;following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studies thus far have not shown a consistent link between cell phone use
and cancers of the brain, nerves, or other tissues of the head or neck.
More research is needed because cell phone technology and how people use
cell phones have been changing&nbsp;rapidly.</p>
<p>&mdash; <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones">National Cancer&nbsp;Institute</a></p>
<p>While <span class="caps">RF</span> energy doesn’t ionize particles, large amounts can increase body
temperatures and cause tissue damage. Two areas of the body, the eyes and
the testes, are particularly vulnerable to RF heating because there is
relatively little blood flow in them to carry away excess&nbsp;heat.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="2-a-potentially-dangerous-battery">2. A potentially dangerous&nbsp;battery</h2>
<p>Granted, not too many people have been <a href="http://www2.wkrg.com/news/2012/nov/21/woman-hospitalized-after-laptop-burns-her-ar-5020883/">burned by laptops</a> or had their
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57481932-83/cell-phone-battery-catches-fire-burns-hackers-tail-at-defcon/">pants singed</a> by flaming cell phone batteries, or <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Man-Claims-Laptop-Fire-Injured-Lungs-191901251.html">claimed lung damage</a> from toxic smoke produced by burning batteries, but these things and
<a href="http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/laptop-s-battery-blamed-for-apartment-fire/article_94e389ea-65bf-11e2-9314-001a4bcf887a.html">even worse</a> have all&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p>Current lithium-ion based battery technology poses an almost inherent risk of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_runaway">thermal runaway</a> and
subsequent fire. Do you want the battery to be right on your head when
thermal runaway occurs and it catches&nbsp;fire?</p>
<h2 id="3-heightened-risk-of-physical-conflict-with-others">3. Heightened risk of physical conflict with&nbsp;others</h2>
<p>You are certainly going to enter environments on a daily basis where Google
Glass will not be welcome. In some cases the severity of unwelcomeness
could be quite high. Simply wearing them in the wrong place at the wrong
time could jeopardize your safety and open you up to pain and suffering from
those who don’t want to be part of your Glass&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="600"><p>Waiting for the first google glass video of someone punching the camera to hit&nbsp;youtube…</p>&mdash; Jared (@_jared) <a href="https://twitter.com/_jared/status/306406689752641538">February 26, 2013</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Example: punched in the face by an intoxicated bar patron for simply looking
stupid or threatening while wearing your Glass. Imagine the results of having
bits of Google Glass punched into your&nbsp;eyeball.</p>
<p>It’s certainly just a matter of time before such a YouTube video is&nbsp;posted.</p>
<h2 id="4-reduced-face-to-face-civility">4. Reduced face to face&nbsp;civility</h2>
<p>We are already fast becoming a civilization of screen staring bubble dwellers,
each in our own little technologically connected worlds and it doesn’t really
matter how small the screen is or where it is&nbsp;positioned.</p>
<p>The rudeness and general degeneration of direct face to face personal
communication with one another brought about by constant cell phone and smart
phone usage will be taken to a new level by technologies like&nbsp;Glass.</p>
<p>How can I be sure when I am talking to someone with this thing on their face,
that they’re even paying attention? Not to mention, I couldn’t possibly have
anything resembling what I would consider a conversation in confidence with
anyone wearing&nbsp;Glass.</p>
<h2 id="5-humans-can-t-really-multi-task">5. Humans can’t really&nbsp;multi-task</h2>
<p>This doesn’t stop us from trying and inevitably people will try to do too
many things while also interacting with Glass. We’ve probably all heard about
or seen videos of people falling <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGRGCvMVqAU">off of</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXYY_ep5Nh0">into things</a> while trying to text
on their phones. Will a heads up display design actually prevent this
kind of problem for Glass users who insist on trying to do too much at&nbsp;once?</p>
<p>Human beings aren’t well equipped to deal with the information density and
distractions presented by a wearable computer, and this will be made more
evident with Glass as users who cannot text and walk at the same time enter
into a whole new dimension of preventable&nbsp;accidents.</p>
<h2 id="6-shit-could-be-snatched-right-off-your-face">6. Shit could be snatched right off your&nbsp;face</h2>
<p>People have iPhones, iPods, and countless other high priced consumer
electronics snatched from their hands on a regular basis, especially in large
metropolitan&nbsp;areas.</p>
<p>Likewise, someone could sneak up on you and easily jack Glass right off your
face for fun and profit. What if they miss in the process and yank out your
hair or poke your eye&nbsp;out?</p>
<p>Probably the best you could hope for is that someone else also wearing Glass
was there to record the future embarrassing YouTube&nbsp;video…</p>
<h2 id="7-the-uhura-factor-">7. The “Uhura&nbsp;Factor”</h2>
<p>We all know how strange people wearing those bluetooth headsets can look.
They’re in airports, discount stores, schools, driving delivery trucks, and
more &mdash; that rare breed of technophile who thinks having a plastic
protuberance stuck in their ear represents the epitome of effortless
technology powered freedom of&nbsp;expression.</p>
<p>Did those things catch on with everyone or what? Of course not, because they
typically make their wearers look like like something out of a terrible
sci fi movie. That or when combined with the right attitude, the user just
ends up coming off as a pompous ass. Glass will likely be met with the same
kind of reception by everyday folks who don’t have 1500 bucks worth of
gadget on their&nbsp;heads.</p>
<p>Want to have private conversations in a hands free manner using your phone?
Choose a corded headset with microphone instead. Why? Because it looks fine and helps with point #1 regarding injecting <span class="caps">RF</span> energy into your cranium
because a wired setup doesn’t do&nbsp;that.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s the list for now. If I think of other problems, I’ll revise this
post and add&nbsp;them.</p>
