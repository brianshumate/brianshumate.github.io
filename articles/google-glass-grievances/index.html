<p>This is not a generalized <strong>oh, my privacy</strong>! exploration into the
implications of the technology, rather it is an enumeration of specific
real-world problems which could result from using Glass. I&apos;d like to also
stress that I did not put these words down to pour water on the Glass
flame, but to merely point out some valid concerns that I have as a
technologist and human being.</p>
<p>I use a bit of rough language at times and a tongue-in-cheek attitude for
some of my points because I&apos;m a just some guy and this is just
some guy&apos;s website.</p>
<p>While much of my thinking on the topic is serious, the nature of this list is
not academic, terribly scientific, or even remotely professional. I am just
shooting the shit here with you about the technology.</p>
<h3 id="0-made-by-a-large-advertising-machine"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#0-made-by-a-large-advertising-machine"><span></span></a>0. Made by a large advertising machine</h3>
<p>Google is perhaps now the largest marketing data aggregator and advertising
machine on Earth. Why would anyone want to wear something on a regular basis
that has the potential to gather the most detailed demographics a person
could offer up to such an advertising and marketing machine?</p>
<p>All the promotional videos feature one perceived benefit after another
for the user. Just as with search, Gmail, and every other service, Google
will be the ones who ultimately gain the most from your use of Glass and
related services.</p>
<p>Basically, all data generated by Glass will pass through some part of Google
for use by them in the ways they&apos;ve specified in those long user agreements that most people do not actually read.</p>
<h3 id="1-an-antenna-and-transceiver-device"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#1-an-antenna-and-transceiver-device"><span></span></a>1. An antenna and transceiver device</h3>
<p>Do you really want a device containing a transceiver and antenna pushing
radio frequency (RF) energy from the ultra high frequency (UHF) Bluetooth,
cellular, and Wi-Fi spectrums in such close proximity to your head?</p>
<p>While there is not much in the way of definitive evidence showing dangers
posed by concentrating UHF RF energy near the human head, I will continue to
err on the side of caution in regards to this point. There&apos;s been about 15
years of research into this issue and we are not yet sure about the
dangers of prolonged RF energy interaction with the human body.</p>
<p>Consider the following quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studies thus far have not shown a consistent link between cell phone use
and cancers of the brain, nerves, or other tissues of the head or neck.
More research is needed because cell phone technology and how people use
cell phones have been changing rapidly.</p>
<p>&#x2014; <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones">National Cancer Institute</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While RF energy doesn&apos;t ionize particles, large amounts can increase body
temperatures and cause tissue damage. Two areas of the body, the eyes and
the testes, are particularly vulnerable to RF heating because there is
relatively little blood flow in them to carry away excess heat.</p>

<h3 id="2-a-potentially-dangerous-battery"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#2-a-potentially-dangerous-battery"><span></span></a>2. A potentially dangerous battery</h3>
<p>Granted, not too many people have been <a href="http://www2.wkrg.com/news/2012/nov/21/woman-hospitalized-after-laptop-burns-her-ar-5020883/">burned by laptops</a> or had their
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57481932-83/cell-phone-battery-catches-fire-burns-hackers-tail-at-defcon/">pants singed</a> by flaming cell phone batteries, or <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Man-Claims-Laptop-Fire-Injured-Lungs-191901251.html">claimed lung damage</a> from toxic smoke produced by burning batteries, but these things and
<a href="http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/laptop-s-battery-blamed-for-apartment-fire/article_94e389ea-65bf-11e2-9314-001a4bcf887a.html">even worse</a> have all happened.</p>
<p>Current lithium-ion based battery technology poses an almost inherent risk of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_runaway">thermal runaway</a> and fire.
Do you want the battery to be right on your head when thermal runaway occurs
and it catches fire?</p>
<h3 id="3-heightened-risk-of-physical-conflict"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#3-heightened-risk-of-physical-conflict"><span></span></a>3. Heightened risk of physical conflict</h3>
<p>You are certainly going to enter environments on a regular basis where Google
Glass will not be welcome. In some cases the severity of unwelcomeness
could be high. Just wearing them in the wrong place at the wrong time could
jeopardize your safety and open you up to pain and suffering from those who
don&apos;t want to be part of your Glass experience.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" width="600"><p>Waiting for the first google glass video of someone punching the camera to hit youtube...</p>&#x2014; Jared (@_jared) <a href="https://twitter.com/_jared/status/306406689752641538">February 26, 2013</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Example: punched in the face by an intoxicated bar patron for looking strange
or threatening while wearing your Glass. Imagine the results of having bits
of Google Glass punched into your eyeball.</p>
<p>It&apos;s certainly just a matter of time before the posting of such a YouTube video.</p>
<h3 id="4-reduced-face-to-face-civility"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#4-reduced-face-to-face-civility"><span></span></a>4. Reduced face to face civility</h3>
<p>We are already fast becoming a civilization of screen staring bubble dwellers,
each in our own little technologically connected worlds and it doesn&apos;t matter
how small the screen is or where it sits on one&apos;s person.</p>
<p>The rudeness and general degeneration of direct face to face personal
communication with one another brought about by constant cell phone and smart
phone usage will reach a new level by technologies like Glass.</p>
<p>How can I be sure when I am talking to someone with this thing on their face,
that they&apos;re even paying attention? Not to mention, I couldn&apos;t possibly have
anything resembling what I would consider a conversation in confidence with
anyone wearing Glass.</p>
<h3 id="5-humans-can-t-multi-task"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#5-humans-can-t-multi-task"><span></span></a>5. Humans can&apos;t multi-task</h3>
<p>This doesn&apos;t stop us from trying and inevitably people will try to do too
much while also interacting with Glass. We&apos;ve probably all heard about
or seen videos of people falling <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGRGCvMVqAU">off of</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXYY_ep5Nh0">into things</a> while trying to text
on their phones. Will a heads up display design actually prevent this
kind of problem for Glass users who insist on trying to do too much at once?</p>
<p>Human beings aren&apos;t well equipped to deal with the information density and
distractions presented by a wearable computer, and this will become more
evident with Glass as users who cannot text and walk at the same time enter
into a whole new dimension of preventable accidents.</p>
<h3 id="6-shit-could-be-snatched-right-off-your-face"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#6-shit-could-be-snatched-right-off-your-face"><span></span></a>6. Shit could be snatched right off your face</h3>
<p>People have iPhones, iPods, and countless other high priced consumer
electronics snatched from their hands on a regular basis, particularly in
large metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>Likewise, someone could sneak up on you and readily jack Glass right off your
face for fun and profit. What if they miss in the process and yank out your
hair or poke your eye out?</p>
<p>Probably the best you could hope for is that someone else also wearing Glass
was there to record the future embarrassing YouTube video...</p>
<h3 id="7-the-uhura-factor-"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#7-the-uhura-factor-"><span></span></a>7. The &quot;Uhura Factor&quot;</h3>
<p>We all know how strange people wearing those bluetooth headsets can look.
They&apos;re in airports, discount stores, schools, driving delivery trucks, and
more &#x2014; that rare breed of technophile who thinks having a plastic
protuberance stuck in their ear represents the epitome of effortless
technology powered freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Did those things catch on with everyone or what? Of course not, because they
typically make their wearer&apos;s appearance resemble something out of a terrible
sci fi movie. That or when combined with the right attitude, the user just
ends up coming off as a pompous ass. Glass will probably meet with the same
kind of reception by everyday folks who don&apos;t have 1500 bucks worth of
gadget on their heads.</p>
<p>Want to have private conversations in a hands free manner using your phone?
Choose a corded headset with microphone instead. Why? Because it looks fine and helps with point #1 above about injecting RF energy into your cranium
because a wired setup doesn&apos;t do that.</p>
<hr>
<p>That&apos;s the list for now. If I think of other problems, I&apos;ll revise this
post and add them.</p>
